# AB Insightful

Project tagline or short summary goes here
Synopsis

Provide a concise overview of the project. Describe the problem your app solves, who it’s for, and what value it adds.
Ab-Insightful helps Shopify merchants analyze customer engagement and customer conversion. AB-Insightful is unique from other A/B testing platforms because it is the first completely native-to-Shopify solution on the market that still offers robust customer tracking and insights. Our product utilizes Shopify’s theme extensions and Polaris Web Components Library to give merchants a familiar user interface and process for creating and deploying alternative websites that can be used for A/B testing. A core feature of our application is robust reporting. Merchants who install our app are able to view metrics such as conversion rates through intuitive UI and easy to read reports.
