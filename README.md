# AB Insightful 
## Synopsis


Ab-Insightful helps Shopify merchants analyze customer engagement and customer conversion. AB-Insightful is unique from other A/B testing platforms because it is the first completely native-to-Shopify solution on the market that still offers robust customer tracking and insights. Our product utilizes Shopify’s theme extensions and Polaris Web Components Library to give merchants a familiar user interface and process for creating and deploying alternative websites that can be used for A/B testing. A core feature of our application is robust reporting. Merchants who install our app are able to view metrics such as conversion rates through intuitive UI and easy to read reports.

## Developer Instructions
Will provide development insight in greater detail during CSC 191. 
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need the following:
Node.js: Download and install it if you haven't already.
Shopify Partner Account: Create an account if you don't have one.
Test Store: Set up either a development store or a Shopify Plus sandbox store for testing your app.
Shopify CLI: Download and install it if you haven't already.
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
If you are on MacOS or linux, you may need to add "sudo" in front of the above command.

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AB-Insightful/ab-insightful.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Install dependencies
npm install
```
Additional libraries for statistical calculation and remix actions
run npm install @stdlib/random-base-beta (for calculating probability of best) run npm install @remix-run/node (for activating actions in jsx)
Also, be sure to to migrate the schema changes to the database as stated above

### Building

Build the app by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:
Using yarn:
`yarn build`
Using npm:
`npm run build`
Using pnpm:
`pnpm run build`

### Testing
_Include steps for running automated or manual tests._

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test
```
_Add any test coverage notes or frameworks used (e.g., Jest, Mocha)._
### Deploying
Will further describe how to deploy the project (e.g., using Docker, Shopify App CLI, or cloud provider setup). Placeholder for deployment instructions until completion of CSC 191.

## Database
_The database is capable of storing experiment data, analysis of the experiment, and relevant user and cookie data. Experiment data is used to track the current experiment, the relevant changes between the main and base cases, and settings for end condition, status, and more.  During the runtime of the experiment, specified goal data is stored to help calculate the analysis of the data.  This is able to determine if the experiment variant is successful or detrimental.  Finally, users and their relevant cookie data are stored to store if they are a part of the experiment, if they are a part of the base or variant, and if they complete the specified goal._
